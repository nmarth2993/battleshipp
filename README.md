# Battleshipp

## The Strategy
The default computer player chooses a random square that has not yet been hit. There is another strategy included which, to my knowledge, is the best possible battleship strategy.

The strategy is an implementation of an amazing writeup done by [DataGenetics](https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/)

## Installation
To run this program yourself, simply download the project and run the included madefile.

Note that the default makefile produces an executable which runs the computer strategy for 100 games.
