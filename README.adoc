Battleshipp
-----------

NOTE: This project was for the purpose of learning C++ and I had limited time to complete it, so there may be some code that could be refactored.

The Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default computer player chooses a random square that has not yet been hit.
There is another strategy included which, to my knowledge, is the best possible battleship strategy.

The strategy is an implementation of an amazing writeup done by DataGenetics:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run this program yourself, simply download the project and run the included makefile.

Note that the default makefile target produces an executable which runs the computer strategy for 500 games.
