- polymorphism only works with pointers because without pointers, the object will be casted at compile-time
- you should never dereference the new operator immediately because it causes a leak since the derference copies
    the data and the pointer to the alloc'd memory is lost
- inheritance of member variables only works with protected access-specifier
- friend operator allows non-member methods to access protected or private data
- operator<< should return an ostream instance to allow chaining of operators
- never manually call destructors (will cause a double free), they are called automatically
- vector.emplace_back() scopes the data into the vector so that the data persists as long as the vector does
- note that const qualified methods are seen as having a completely separate header, so it is easy
    to overlook declaring a const method in the base class and defining a non-const method in the derived class
    the error passes silently because it will just use the base class method with no warning
